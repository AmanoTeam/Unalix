Unalix is a library written in Python, it follows the same specification used by the [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) addon for removing tracking fields from URLs.

#### Installation

Install using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall \
    --disable-pip-version-check \
    --upgrade \
    'unalix'
```

The version from git might be broken sometimes, but you can also install from it:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall \
    --disable-pip-version-check \
    --upgrade \
    'https://codeload.github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix/tar.gz/refs/heads/master'
```

_**Note**: Unalix requires Python 3.6 or higher._

#### Usage:

Removing tracking fields:

```python
import unalix

url: str = "https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer"
result: str = unalix.clear_url(url=url)

assert result == "https://deezer.com/track/891177062"
```

Unshort shortened URL:

```python
import unalix

url: str = "https://bitly.is/Pricing-Pop-Up"
result: str = unalix.unshort_url(url=url)

assert result == "https://bitly.com/pages/pricing"
```

_**Tip**: The `unshort_url()` method will strip tracking fields from any URL before following a redirect, so you don't need to manually call `clear_url()` for it's return value._
