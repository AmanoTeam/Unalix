### What it does?

In addition to removing tracking fields from URLs, Unalix also try to gets the direct link from shortened URLs.

### Installation

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade 'unalix'
```
or
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix'
```

The git repository will always have the most recent changes, so it is recommended that you install/update the module through it.

### Usage:

Let's see some examples:

**On a Python3 console:**

```python
from unalix import clear_url, unshort_url

url = 'http://example.com/?utm_source=google'
result = clear_url(url)
 
print(result)
 
url = 'http://goo.gl/ko4LWp'
result = unshort_url(url)

print(result)

```

Output:

```bash
http://example.com/
https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-youtube-vanced-edition-t3758757
```
### Limitations

- Getting direct links from URL shorteners
  - Unalix only follows the URLs/paths provided by the `Location` header (see [RFC 7231, section 7.1.2: Location](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2)). It means that Unalix cannot obtain direct links from URL shorteners that require user interaction (e.g clicking a button or resolving CAPTCHA) to redirect or that uses JavaScript code to redirect.
