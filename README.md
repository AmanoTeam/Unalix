Unalix is a library written in Python, it follows the same specification used by the [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) addon for removing tracking fields from URLs.

#### Installation

Install using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall \
    --disable-pip-version-check \
    --upgrade \
    'unalix'
```

The version from git might be broken sometimes, but you can also install from it:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall \
    --disable-pip-version-check \
    --upgrade \
    'https://codeload.github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix/tar.gz/refs/heads/master'
```

_**Note**: Unalix requires Python 3.6 or higher._

#### Usage:

Removing tracking fields:

```python
import unalix

url = "https://deezer.com/track/891177062?utm_source=deezer"
result = unalix.clear_url(url)

print(result)
```

Unshort shortened URL:

```python
import unalix

url = "https://bitly.is/Pricing-Pop-Up"
result = unalix.unshort_url(url)

print(result)
```

Output from both examples:

```bash
https://deezer.com/track/891177062
https://bitly.com/pages/pricing
```

_**Tip**: `unshort_url()` will strip tracking fields from any URL before following a redirect, so you don't need to manually call `clear_url()` for it._

#### Contributing

If you have discovered a bug in this library and know how to fix it, fork this repository and open a Pull Request.

If you found a URL that was not fully cleaned by Unalix (e.g. some tracking fields still remains), report them here or in the [ClearURLs rules repository](https://gitlab.com/anti-tracking/ClearURLs/rules/-/issues). We use the list of regex rules maintained by the ClearURLs maintainers, but we also have our [own list](./unalix/package_data/rulesets/unalix.json).
