### Limitations

Unalix has some limitations related to link processing, see them below:

#### Getting direct links from URL shorteners

Unalix only follows the URLs/paths provided by the `Location` header (see [RFC 7231, section 7.1.2: Location](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2)). It means that Unalix cannot obtain direct links from URL shorteners that require user interaction (e.g clicking a button or resolving CAPTCHA) to redirect or that uses JavaScript code to redirect.
